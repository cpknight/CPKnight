I'm a maker of software, firmware, and hardware for autonomous systems that strengthen human decision-making by streamlining the intelligence cycle, a process akin to OODA loops or business decision-making frameworks. It covers direction (setting clear objectives), collection (gathering relevant data), analysis (merging and interpreting information), and dissemination (sharing actionable insights). My work ensures humans stay central, guiding tech to amplify their choices.

The [Paro](https://github.com/cpknight/Paro) devices handle missions for data collection and real-time analysis, assigned through the direction process. They’re built to be durable yet affordable, deployable at scale in tough environments. The cloud-based platform at [reconnaissance.services](https://reconnaissance.services) integrates the full cycle—defining objectives, collecting data, analyzing it, and sharing results—with direction as the critical starting point to align every step.

My [projects and repositories](https://github.com/cpknight/projects) explore embedded systems, neural networks for image and vision processing, and modular software that fits into broader workflows. I’m inspired by applications where timely insights save lives, like forest firefighting, search-and-rescue, or public safety.
